# Super Metroid Remake

<div style="text-align: justify">
Before I started my studies at Digital Arts and Entertainment, I had never created a fully functional game before. During the second semester of my first-year game development this became the exact task we had to complete. As I already had programming experience from my prior studies, I challenged myself by creating a remake of my favorite SNES game Super Metroid. <br>
Looking back at this code from 2021, although everything was functional, I clearly lacked a lot of knowledge about the C++ language. However, even if the code wasn’t perfect, the creation of this game was an unforgettable learning experience. Furthermore, I’m glad to see that my recent code has become a lot more readable and efficient since then.<br>
Feel free to play this small remake using the Zip file stored in the Mega Cloud <a class="text-gPrimaryColor" href="https://mega.nz/file/p24ECK4A#I66Cjterds3a0KRLEagWyvvX6p4RtdWs4IG6_8iXYBE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!

After grading, my project got featured on the official DAE website along with some other students. This link can be found <a class="text-gPrimaryColor" href="https://digitalartsandentertainment.be/article/468/Programming+2%3A+2021+Post+Mortem">here</a>.
