# Tree-Umph

Three-Umph was a game jam entry project for the DAE CreaWeek Game Jam 2022, which had ‘Peace and Chaos” as theme. This game was created in the timespan of three days with an amazing team of 6 people. I, obviously, contributed as a programmer<br> <br>

Climb as a cute creature to the top of an enormous tree to reclaim your eggs. However, be wary of all the debris falling from the tree. Luckily, you can slow down time to open up a path. Compete against others for a faster time and enjoy this speed running adventure.
In context of the game jam theme, the debris falling represents the chaos, while your slow-motion ability depicts the peace.
